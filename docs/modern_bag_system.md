# Modern Bag Expansion & Auto-Sorting

This document outlines the planned modernization of the Bag system for Pokémon Legends Awakening.

## Overview
- Expand the Bag to use thirteen dedicated pockets:
  1. Medicine
  2. Poké Balls
  3. Battle Items
  4. Berries
  5. TMs/HMs/TRs
  6. Key Items
  7. Z-Crystals
  8. Mega Stones
  9. Treasures
  10. Evolution
  11. Held Items
  12. Ingredients
  13. Miscellaneous

- Each pocket will support at least 200–300 entries and will have its own scrolling list and tab within the Bag menu.

## Automatic Pocket Assignment
- Items obtained through pickups, trades, gifts, or save migration will be automatically sorted into their appropriate pocket.
- Manual reassignment between pockets will not be required.

## Sorting Features
- Items within each pocket can be reordered by:
  - Alphabetical order (A–Z or Z–A)
  - Item type or category
  - Most recently obtained
  - Optionally by favorite flag or quantity

## User Interface
- The Bag menu will present modern tabs/icons for all pockets with smooth navigation.
- Item entries show icons and quantities and support rapid scrolling for large inventories.

## Save Migration
- When upgrading from earlier versions, existing items will be redistributed automatically to the new pockets.
- The migration routine will confirm that every item is preserved.

## Testing
- Comprehensive tests will cover pocket capacities, sorting stability, save migration, and edge cases such as empty or overfilled pockets.

This document serves as a roadmap; further clarification on individual pocket rules or UI behavior may be requested during implementation.
